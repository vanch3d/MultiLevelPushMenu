## CHANGELOG 
This fork made some changes to the underlying layout (and associated CSS) in order to prevent scrolling on the main page of the site, once the menu is activated. This was partly to fit the main webapp it was going to be deployed into (see vanch3d/nvl-slim).
HOWEVER, I haven't made the relevant changes to the demo, which means they are not woorking anymore.
Will fix that as soon as possible
